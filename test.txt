Canonical, 40%.  For this program, “canonical” refers to the results and your analysis of them.  Of course, this
requires that you get results.  If you make an error in one of the implementations, this will not influence your
canonical grade, so long as you appear to be analyzing the results you achieved.  If you don’t get one lock to work,
it may have a slight effect on your Canonical grade; the largest effect would be if you didn’t get the Backoff Lock
to work, since that has tunable parameters. Correctness, 30%.  For this program, “correctness” refers to the correctness
of your implementation of the shared counter and the six algorithms.  5% per algorithm. Cohesiveness (15%), Clarity
(5%), and Commentary (5%) are self-explanatory. Due October 31st, 11:59 PM.  Scary thought.
